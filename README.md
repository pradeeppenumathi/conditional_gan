# conditional_gan

In order to create handwritten digits with certain characteristics, this project focuses on the use of 
Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) on the MNIST dataset. The stated issue is 
how to produce realistic and varied digit images based on characteristics such as digit class, stroke 
thickness, or tilt. The suggested method combines a generator and discriminator network to 
create digit pictures with required properties while also learning the underlying patterns of 
numbers in the dataset.

The technique used by Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) involves developing 
a generative model (the generator) to generate images that are conditional on particular input 
conditions or labels. The classic GAN architecture is extended by the cGAN framework by adding 
labels to control the generation of images. Labels, text descriptions, or other variables that control 
the generator and discriminator
